# IthacaRideShare

## Project Description
This website allows users who can offer a ride to a nearby city to post their information on the website. Information should include time, destination, available seats,  and a share fee (if demanded). Users looking for a ride to a particular city can search for a posted offer and book the ride on the website. After booking, the user who posts the ride will be able to see their information and contact them if needed. This website should consist of the following pages:

### Home
This page should have two butttoms for the users to click：1. post a ride； 2. seek for a ride. Upon clicking one buttom, the Home page should be redirected to the corresponding page.

### Post a Ride
This page should allow the users to input their information, including date, time, departure city, destination, number of seats available, a share fee, and their personal information (name, email, and phone number). These information has to be filled out, and there is also a space to leave optional comments. 

### Seek for a ride
This page displays a list of offered rides. On the top of the page, there is a search bar so the users can type in the departure and destination cities and the page should display the applicable rides. There is also a sort on the top right of the page that can sort the offered rides based on time, share fee (mininum to maxinum), and number of seats available. After the user click on one specific ride, a new page will be directed to that contains more detailed information about the ride.

### Information 
This page displayed all the details regarding the ride. On the buttom left, there is a "Back to Search" buttom and the page will be directed back to Seek for a ride page. On the buttom right, there is a confirm buttom, which directs to the Confirm page.

### Comfirm
This page asks the user to comfirm the ride and leave their information (name, email, and phone numnber). On the buttom left, there is a "Back to Search" buttom if the user no longer wants to book this ride. Upon the user confirmed this ride, their information will be sent to the poster of the ride and they will receive a confirmation email that include ride details and the poster's information. 

### Addtional features 
1. create an account
2. delete a ride
3. cancel booking (before 48 hours)
