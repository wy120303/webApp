# IthacaRideShare

## Project Description
This website allows users who can offer a ride to a nearby city to post their information on the website. Information should include time, destination, available seats,  and a share fee (if demanded). Users looking for a ride to a particular city can search for a posted offer and book the ride on the website. After booking, the user who posts the ride will be able to see their information and contact them if needed. This website should consist of the following pages:

## Greeting Page
Shows the name of the website and a brief description of it. Also asks the user to log in or create an account. After logged in, the user will be directed to the home page.

### Home
This page should have two butttoms for the users to click：1. post a ride； 2. seek for a ride. Upon clicking one buttom, the Home page should be redirected to the corresponding page.

### Post a Ride
This page should allow the users to input their information, including date, time, departure city, destination, number of seats available, a share fee. These information has to be filled out, and there is also a space to leave optional comments. 

### Seek for a ride
This page displays a list of offered rides. On the top of the page, there is a search bar so the users can type in the departure and destination cities and the page should display the applicable rides. There is also a sort on the top right of the page that can sort the offered rides based on time, share fee (mininum to maxinum), and number of seats available. After the user click on one specific ride, a new page will be directed to that contains more detailed information about the ride.
